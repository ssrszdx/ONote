# Write 5x more but write 5x less
There are 2 things I have come to believe about writing:

1. **The average person should write 5x more things than they do.**
2. **The average written thing should be 5x shorter than it is.**

See? Write 5x more but write 5x less. Write [more often](https://critter.blog/2021/01/18/consistency-beats-quality/), but make each thing you write shorter.

I don’t care what it is. Blog posts. Novels. Google docs. Articles. Wiki pages. Write more of them, but [make them shorter](https://critter.blog/2021/10/28/write-shorter-nonfiction-books-please/).

Why write more often?

- Because writing [helps thinking](https://critter.blog/2021/05/07/200-daily-blog-posts/).
- Because [practice](https://critter.blog/2020/11/18/discipline-eats-motivation-for-breakfast/) will make you better.
- Because [writing is more shareable](https://critter.blog/2021/08/06/put-it-in-writing/) than speaking.
- Because humans are worse than computers at storing knowledge.
- Because writing your old thoughts frees your brain to think of new thoughts.

Why make them shorter?

- Because the [shorter it is](https://critter.blog/2021/01/29/use-the-smallest-word-that-does-the-job/), the more people will read it.
- Because of the [Pareto principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle): 80% of the value is in 20% of the length (hence “5x shorter”).

So write more, but write less.
